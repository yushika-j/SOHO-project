# SOHO-project

In this project, I designed a small office network and configured key network components like IP addresses, subnets, and gateways for all connected devices. After setting everything up, I successfully tested the network by pinging two PCs, confirming that the network was working perfectly!

🔑 Key Highlights:

Configured IP addressing and subnetting for devices.
Set up gateway settings to enable proper communication.
Successfully tested connectivity using the ping command.
This hands-on experience allowed me to strengthen my skills in network design and troubleshooting. It’s always fulfilling to see everything come together in a real-world network simulation! 😊

Looking forward to taking on more complex network configurations and learning even more in the networking field. 💻🌐
